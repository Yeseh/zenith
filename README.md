# Zenith

## Description
Zenith is a tool for creating and running serverless code like Azure Functions, AWS Lambda etc.
The core logic of the tool (management API, CLI and container handling) is written in Go.

Zenith uses Docker containers to build images for user-provided code. For now, only Deno functions are supported.

This is mainly a learning/for-fun project project to gain better understanding of containerization, and serverless runtimes :)
